Food Image classification is the process of taking an input like “image”and output us in the form of class like (“food”,”non-food”) or a probability of the particular class (there’s is a probability of 95% that it belongs to class food).


Goal: Building a machine learning model that can distinguish between food and non-food class using CNN for given an input of image.
